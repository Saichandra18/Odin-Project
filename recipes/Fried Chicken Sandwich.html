    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons hot sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons paprika, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin preparing chicken: place chicken thighs in a medium bowl. Add
        buttermilk and hot sauce and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at
        least 1 hour, or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare waffles: combine waffle mix, water, egg, and oil in a medium
        bowl; whisk until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Preheat a mini waffle
        maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray waffle maker with cooking spray. Cook waffles one at a time until
        golden brown. Place cooked waffles on a baking sheet and place in the
        oven to keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish preparing chicken: heat 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C) in a deep cast iron skillet or Dutch oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        While oil heats, combine flour, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon garlic
        powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a shallow dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken thighs from the buttermilk mixture one at a time and
        allow excess to drip off. Coat chicken lightly in flour mixture and
        shake off any excess. Repeat the process once more, dipping chicken back
        in the buttermilk mixture and flour mixture, and shaking off any excess.
        Place chicken on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat to
        coat remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry 2 chicken thighs at a time in the hot oil until an instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center reads 170 degrees F (77 degrees F),
        turning 2 to 3 times, about 8 minutes per batch. Drain chicken on a
        clean wire rack set inside a paper towel-lined baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine remaining paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper with cayenne
        pepper and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Carefully whisk in 1 cup of the
        hot frying oil. Brush each fried chicken thigh with the spicy oil
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Stir maple syrup into the remaining spice mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Place 1 piece of chicken on a waffle and top with 1/4 cup coleslaw.
        Drizzle with 2 teaspoons of the spicy maple mixture and place a second
        waffle on top. Repeat with remaining ingredients and serve immediately.
